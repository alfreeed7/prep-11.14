        The .transition() in d3 algorithim is used to create animations. The animations is done through the transitions between different charts or graphs, so before we do the transitions, we need to have the different graphs set up firstly. There are many other elements to help make the animations cooler, such as .duration(), which determines the length of the animation, .delay() which determines the time before the actual action takes place, and the .ease(), which is used to specify the transition effect by managing the speed of how the transition happens.
